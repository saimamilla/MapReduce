  "reviewText": "I just received my router today and have not tried it yet but,I did checked it out and found that it has plenty of power no broken components and everything works as it should BUT, it was suppose to come with its own carrying case and a full template guide kit according to the product description and was very disappointed that I did not receive them! that is the reason I only gave it three stars. I will be ordering from other companies that I know that I can trust and rely on and that are truthful in their product description ! New update: just called customer service and they informed me that yes I was supposed to get the other items BUT in order to do that,I would have to send the router package back and they would resend me another router package but it would be complete however instead of waiting for the new router they would give me a 50 dollar promotional certificate instead that I can use on any of their products. I accepted the certificate.",
  "summary": "well built router but,not all complete package/update",
